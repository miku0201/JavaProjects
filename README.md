# JavaProjects

This is a collection of Java GUI projects I've made using Swing/AWT since high school. Each project runs as a standalone app with interactive graphics and logic.

## Projects Included

- **PeriodicTable.java** – Interactive periodic table with tooltips and element info popups.
- **FlappyFrame/FlappyPanel.java** – Flappy bird Game
- **SnakeGame.java** – Improvised Snake game that has features from slither.io and is a 2 player game
- **RouletteFrame/Panel.java** – very simple roulette game
- **GeoFrame/Panel.java** – really basic geometry dash game

## How to Run

- Use any Java IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
- Requires Java 17 or later.
- Compile and run the frame class (e.g., `GeoFrame.java`, `SnakeGame.java`).
